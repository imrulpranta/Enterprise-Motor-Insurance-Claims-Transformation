Enterprise Motor Insurance Claims Transformation

Automation, Risk Optimisation and Responsible AI Governance Framework

Overview

This repository documents a structured end to end redesign of a high volume motor insurance claims lifecycle within a regulated general insurance operating environment.

The objective of the initiative was not limited to automation. It focused on improving operational efficiency, strengthening fraud controls, enhancing SLA governance, and embedding responsible AI oversight within a defensible enterprise framework.

The transformation demonstrates how a traditional, manual claims process can be restructured into a coordinated, risk aware, and governance aligned operating model suitable for large regulated institutions.

Business Context

Motor insurance claims operations are high volume, time sensitive, financially material, and subject to regulatory oversight.

The legacy operating model presented several challenges:

High levels of manual data entry and rework

Reactive and inconsistent fraud detection practices

SLA breach rate of approximately 18 percent

Limited audit traceability and decision logging

Fragmented escalation and approval processes

These issues increased operational cost, fraud exposure, compliance risk, and customer dissatisfaction.

Solution Summary

The redesigned operating model introduces a five layer automation architecture supported by structured risk controls and governance mechanisms.

1. Customer Layer

Digital claim submission portal

Secure document upload capability

Automated intake timestamp capture for SLA tracking

2. Automation Layer

UiPath Orchestrator for workflow management

Unattended RPA robots

Queue management and prioritisation logic

Risk based routing controls

3. Processing Layer

OCR based document ingestion

Rule based eligibility validation

Fraud risk scoring model on a 0 to 100 scale

Automated SLA monitoring capability

4. Core Systems Layer

Claims management system integration

Policy database integration

Payment system integration

Centralised audit logging

5. Governance Layer

SLA and operational dashboards

Risk monitoring framework

Model performance oversight

Bias and control monitoring mechanisms

This layered approach separates orchestration, decision intelligence, system integration, and governance functions to support scalability and control integrity.

Fraud Risk Scoring Framework

A structured fraud scoring model generates a risk score between 0 and 100 using indicators such as:

Historical anomaly detection

Claim value deviation

Policy tenure

Claims frequency patterns

Document inconsistencies

Risk Routing Logic

0 to 40: Straight through processing

41 to 70: Claims officer review

71 and above: Fraud team escalation

Artificial intelligence operates in an assistive capacity only. Automated rejection is not permitted. All decisions remain subject to human review and are fully logged for audit purposes.

SLA Governance

The redesigned framework embeds proactive SLA controls:

Intake timestamp tracking

Early warning alerts at defined thresholds

Supervisor escalation triggers

Real time dashboard reporting

This replaces manual monitoring with structured and measurable SLA governance.

Estimated Impact

Projected outcomes of the transformation include:

25 to 35 percent reduction in manual handling effort

30 percent improvement in processing time

40 percent reduction in SLA breaches

15 to 20 percent improvement in fraud detection precision

Enhanced audit transparency and compliance defensibility

Estimated return on investment within 12 to 18 months

Responsible AI Governance

The solution incorporates a human in the loop AI model to balance efficiency with accountability.

Key principles include:

AI scoring provides decision support only

No autonomous claim rejection

Mandatory human review for medium and high risk cases

Full audit logging of decisions and overrides

Periodic model performance and bias review

This ensures regulatory defensibility while enabling intelligent automation.

Capabilities Demonstrated

This case study demonstrates practical capability in:

End to end process discovery and analysis

As Is and To Be process modelling

Enterprise automation architecture design

Risk and control framework integration

AI assisted decision support design

SLA governance implementation

Financial impact assessment within a regulated environment

Strategic Outcome

This project illustrates how a high volume financial services workflow can be modernised while embedding governance, fraud prevention, operational resilience, and responsible technology integration.

It reflects enterprise level thinking aligned with the expectations of large regulated insurance institutions.
